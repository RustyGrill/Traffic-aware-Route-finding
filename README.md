# Traffic-aware-Route-finding

A **DSA-powered route planner** that finds optimal paths between locations on a map using classic algorithms. It also simulates **real-time traffic** by randomly changing road weights.

## 🔧 Features

- 🧭 Shortest Path using **Dijkstra** and **A\***
- 🌐 All-Pairs Path using **Floyd-Warshall**
- 🚦 Traffic simulation with dynamic edge weights
- 🔗 Connectivity checks using **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**
- 💻 Interactive **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
